# Introduction

Olive flies are among one of the many species of flies that live around plants and stocks. They are considered as being a pest to the olives. That is why it can be benifitial to olive farmers to identify the flies on their stocks. There are however many more types of flies that exist on the olives that might not be harmfull to the plants. Therefore a method of just counting every fly would not work as that would result in false data and potentially incorrect and inadequate pest control. In order to be able to better control the flies and protect the olives, a farmer must know roughly how many olive flies there actually are on the olives.

This kind of classification model is a perfect example of multiple logistic regression and a good first project for new learners. The project involves important fundemental steps like data pre-processing, model construction and training and model evaluation.
